            I create because I must, because there is too much within my mind and my heart to be contained within my own self.
            I must express, I must expunge, this filthy excess of feeling and fear and passion and desire.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            I create to honor the profound beauty and terror of nature and the endless cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth,
            and to channel these same forces within my creative work to manifest transformation and transcendence.
        </p>
