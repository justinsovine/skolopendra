            Based in Olympia, WA, Skolopendra Studio owner and artist Emily Kaelin offers strange and compelling artistry and creations inspired by the beauty and chaos of nature and life,
            honoring its shades both light and dark, and its forms both beautiful and fearsome.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Specializing in oils, acrylics, watercolor, gouache, mixed media, sculpture, installation, and more, Emily’s creations evoke the organic complexity of the natural world, frequently intertwining
            both beautiful and grotesque elements resulting in work that is deeply fascinating and compelling, revealing new details, layers, and facets upon closer and closer inspection.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Skolopendra Studio showcases a myriad of Emily’s artistic offerings, including oil paintings, watercolors, abstract sculptures, and handcrafted wands and scepters.
