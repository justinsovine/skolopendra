        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In tandem with my visual art practice, I have also spent over 15 years composing multiple forms of experimental and electronic music - an outgrowth of the musical
            training I received in piano and guitar in my youth. I am currently focusing on songwriting, synths, and vocals in an eclectic music project - VKVEENA (pronounced “ook-VEE-nuh”) - 
            which takes inspiration from industrial, witch house, harsh noise, black metal/doom metal, dark ambient, and other genres to create dark, intense, and
            experimental storytelling through song and sound.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            VKVEENA’s first EP, titled “Annihilation”, is due to be released in the coming months, but the single “Like a Stone” (Audioslave cover) is currently available on Spotify, 
            Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and YouTube for your listening pleasure!

            Although VKVEENA has been a solo-project up until now, I am soon to expand my sound through the addition of a guitarist, and I am also looking for a live drummer to 
            complete the picture! If you’re a local drummer proficient in multiple forms of metal-style drumming - black metal in particular - and love dark and insane music, 
            please feel free to reach out to me via email! <a href="mailto:skolopendraaa.studio@gmail.com" class="text-lime-400">skolopendraaa.studio@gmail.com</a>
