                Originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, I moved to the Olympia, WA area in September 2024 - a goal Iâ€™ve worked towards for over a decade! 
                Yearning to live closely with the remarkable beauty of the forests local to this part of the country, and the incredible healing, 
                peace, and awe they provide me - not to mention artistic inspiration - are my primary motivations in relocating to this area.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I spent well over a decade working actively in the underground art and music scene in my hometown of Cincinnati, 
            participating in as well as curating numerous exhibitions and events, utilizing my full range of creative skills 
            from painting and sculpture to installation and set design, to performance and music.
