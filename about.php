                    Originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, I moved to the Olympia, WA area in September 2024—a goal I’ve worked towards for over a decade! 
                    Yearning to live closely with the remarkable beauty of the forests local to this part of the country, and the incredible healing, peace, and awe they provide me—
                    not to mention artistic inspiration—are my primary motivations in relocating to this area.

                    But I also came to Washington to find new paths to traverse on my journey as an artist and creator, and I’m excited to find and connect with other creators and 
                    lovers of strange, dark, and provocative art in all its forms!

                    I spent well over a decade working actively in the underground art and music scene in my hometown of Cincinnati, participating in as well as curating numerous exhibitions 
                    and events, utilizing my full range of creative skills from painting and sculpture, to installation and set design, to performance and music.
